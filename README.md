# Got Next
Hey! Welcome to Got Next!
Have you ever wanted to play sports or play a game but you simply did not have enough people? 
Well Got Next is your solution. Got Next is an iOS application that allows it users to find 
others to play sports (or do other events) with. Simply sign up, make an event posting and find people
to play with. Set a posting for today or sometime in the future, specify a location and you are good 
to go! Still currently in development but feel free to look below for some early looks into the app!
